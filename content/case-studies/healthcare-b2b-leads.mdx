## The challenge

A healthcare B2B company sold specialised medical equipment. Their website had strong product pages but minimal thought leadership or informational content. Competitors ranked for "how to choose", "vs" and "guide" queries. Lead volume from organic was negligible.

## Approach

We designed a hub-and-spoke content architecture:

- Pillar pages for each major product category
- Spoke content targeting long-tail informational queries
- E-E-A-T emphasis: author bios, clinical advisor contributions, citations
- Technical improvements to ensure key pages were crawled and indexed efficiently

Content prioritisation used search volume, commercial intent and competitive difficulty. We focused on topics where the client had genuine expertise.

## Results

- Organic lead form submissions up 120% over 8 months
- Top 3 rankings for 15+ high-value commercial terms
- Significant increase in branded search (+45%)
- Content assets repurposed for sales and partner channels

## Key learnings

E-E-A-T in healthcare requires real expertise, not manufactured credibility. Involving clinical advisors in content improved both rankings and conversion.
