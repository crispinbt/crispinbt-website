## The challenge

A regional service business with 12 locations wanted to improve local search visibility. Some locations ranked well, others were absent from the local pack. NAP (name, address, phone) was inconsistent across the web. Review volume varied widely by location.

## Approach

We conducted a full local SEO audit:

- GBP optimisation: categories, descriptions, services, Q&A, photos
- Location page audit: each location had a dedicated page but structure and content needed improvement
- NAP consistency: fixed discrepancies in citations and directories
- Review strategy: structured process for generating genuine reviews
- Local link building: chambers of commerce, local publications, industry directories

## Results

- All 12 target locations now appear in top 3 of the local pack for primary queries
- In-store and phone enquiries from organic/local up 60%
- Review count doubled across locations
- Local pack visibility during peak season improved significantly

## Key learnings

Local SEO is highly location-specific. A one-size-fits-all approach fails; each location needs tailored optimisation and consistent monitoring.
