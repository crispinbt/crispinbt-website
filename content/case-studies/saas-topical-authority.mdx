## The challenge

A B2B SaaS company had solid product-market fit but struggled to appear in search for their category. Incumbents had years of content and stronger link profiles. The client needed a way to compete without a massive content budget.

## Approach

We built a topical authority strategy:

- Mapped the full keyword universe for their category and adjacent topics
- Created pillar content for core themes, with supporting cluster content
- Programmatic content approach for high-volume, lower-competition long-tail queries
- Refreshed and consolidated legacy blog content with proper internal linking
- Link acquisition via original data, calculators and embeddable tools

Technical SEO ensured fast indexing of new content. Schema markup improved SERP visibility.

## Results

- Organic sign-ups increased 85% over 12 months
- Domain authority grew from 28 to 42
- Featured snippets secured for 8 high-value terms
- Long-tail programmatic pages drove significant incremental traffic

## Key learnings

Topical authority compounds. Early investment in structure and internal linking paid off as each new piece of content strengthened the whole cluster.
