## The challenge

A mid-sized e-commerce brand had migrated to a new platform. Within weeks, organic traffic dropped by 60%. Rankings for core category and product terms disappeared. The client needed a fast diagnosis and clear action plan.

## Approach

A technical audit revealed:

- Large chunks of product URLs were not indexed after migration
- Redirect chains from legacy URLs were broken or inefficient
- Core Web Vitals had regressed, particularly LCP
- Several key category pages had been consolidated without proper redirects

We prioritised fixes using a RICE-style framework: indexing first, then redirects, then performance. A content gap analysis identified where competitors had gained ground during the disruption.

## Results

- Traffic recovered to pre-migration levels within 4 months
- Revenue from organic search up 35% year-on-year
- Key category terms back in top 5
- Core Web Vitals passing across key landing pages

## Key learnings

Migration audits need to run in parallel with the build, not after. Indexing monitoring from day one would have caught the gap earlier.
